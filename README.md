# CS601 Term Project

For my term project, I chose to do the default project type, a biography. This biography consists of 5 main pages:
* Home
* Hobbies
* Instagram
* Resume
* Contact

## Home

This is the main "Biography" that describes who I am, what I like to do and my professional career. There is also a portrait of me with little hover feature.

## Hobbies

This page contains a list of my hobbies. There is a gallery of images of the hobbies I enjoy in a flex fitting fashion. The gallery is modular in that an image can be dropped in any row and it will automatically display in the resolution of the image with a border, next to the other images. There is also a video for a trailer of one of the games I play.

## Instagram

This page contains images of my instagram. It uses embedded links provided from my instagram that give the user the feature of navigating to my instagram page.

## Resume

This page contains my resume, embedded from a google doc, that scales to the width of the webpage. Above the document are links references in the google doc that highlight on hover.

## Contact

This page allows users to contact me using a real backend solution in the form of a firestore database. The user is able to enter their name, email and a message to me that is validated and stored in my database for me to review later. The user is also presented with the ability to view messages they have previously sent using the Messsages Sent option. This feature returns messages sent by a user by providing the email they used to contact me. They also have the option to delete some of their messages by clicking on the X. This will remove the message from the page and the database.

## Navigation

The navigation bar is consistent across all pages and scales to the width of the webpage

## Dark Mode

To the left of the navigation bar, there is a switch that allows users to change the background color and text color to a 'dark mode', reducing the brightness of the webpage. There is a little animation included in the switch toggling.
