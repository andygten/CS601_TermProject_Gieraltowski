            Hey, I'm Andrew, an embedded software engineer who's equally passionate about technology and outdoor adventures. 
            Originally from the Pittsburgh Pennsylvania area, I attended Penn State University, where I aquired a degree in computer engineering.
        </p>
        <p>
            My first job out of college landed me in the city of Buffalo, New York. While there I honed my programming skills and
            decided to take it a step further by applying for grad school. That's how I ended up in Boston, at least for a little while
            until the pandemic struck. During covid, I found myself back in Pittsburgh as work, life and school went fully remote. I only
            have a few classes left before I graduate, I'm almost there!
        </p>
        <p>
            Outside of programming and engineering, you can find me on a local running or biking trail!
            I enjoy long distance running but have only competed in a single half-marathon.
        </p>
        <p>
            To relax, I often spend my time playing video games or binge watching my favorite shows!
        </p>
        <p>
            Recently, I made a significant life change and moved to Philadelphia. My job affords me to oppurtunities to work
            and live where I want and my partner is completing her residency in a city close to Philadelphia, so it made
            the most sense to move here. I've enjoyed Philly so far and I'm excited to explore my new found urban environment.
        </p>
